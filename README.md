# Airbnb-Amsterdam Project - Python Code

Using data provided by Airbnb, I selected a city and performed exploratory and machine learning analysis. After the analysis, I created visuals using tableau and python. With those visuals and analysis, a tableau dashboard/presentation was created. The presentation is the in "sent to client" folder.
